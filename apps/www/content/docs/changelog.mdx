#### March 2024 - Component Updates

This month, we are excited to introduce two new components to our UI library: `NftCard` and `NftsByAccount` (previously referred to as Collection). These additions aim to enhance the way NFTs are displayed and interacted with in your projects.

### NftCard

The `NftCard` component is designed to showcase NFT metadata, including images, names, and collection details, in a card format. This component makes it easier for developers to integrate NFT displays into their applications with customizable options for theming and layout.

### NftsByAccount

Following the `NftCard`, the `NftsByAccount` component allows for the dynamic display of NFTs associated with a specific account address. This component supports pagination, filtering by collection names, and theming, providing a comprehensive solution for displaying user or account-specific NFT collections.
