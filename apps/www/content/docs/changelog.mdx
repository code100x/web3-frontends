## March 2024 - NftCard and Collection

We've added a new Breadcrumb component and an Input OTP component.

### Breadcrumb

An accessible and flexible breadcrumb component. It has support for collapsed items, custom separators, bring-your-own routing `<Link />` and composable with other code100x/ui components.

<ComponentPreview name="nft-card-demo" />

[See more examples](/docs/components/nft-card)
