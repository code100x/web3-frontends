#### Environment Setup

To utilize the `NftsByAccount` component effectively, you must have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFTSCAN_KEY` environment variable configured within your project. This key enables the fetching of NFT data via the NFTScan API.

Ensure your `.env` file at the root of your project contains the following line:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFTSCAN_KEY=your_nftscan_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_nftscan_api_key_here` with the actual API key obtained from the NFTScan developers portal. Visit [NFTScan developers portal](https://developer.nftscan.com/) to register and generate an API key.

#### Usage

Begin by importing the `NftsByAccount` component:

```tsx
import { NftsByAccount } from "@/components/ui/nfts-by-account"
```

Then, incorporate it into your project, specifying the necessary props:

```tsx
<NftsByAccount
  accountAddress="SolanaAccountAddressHere"
  collectionName="OptionalCollectionName"
  limit={4}
/>
```

#### Props

- `accountAddress`: The blockchain account address to fetch NFTs for.
- `collectionName`: (Optional) Specify a collection name to filter NFTs within the account.
- `limit`: Number of NFTs to display per page. Defaults to 2.

#### Examples
